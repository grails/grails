Try performing some basic CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.

h4. Create

To create a domain class use the Groovy new operator, set its properties and call [save|domainClasses]:

{code}
def p = new Person(name:"Fred", age:40, lastVisit:new Date())
p.save()
{code}

The [save|domainClasses] method will persist your class to the database using the underlying Hibernate ORM layer.

h4. Read

Grails transparently adds an implicit @id@ property to your domain class which you can use for retrieval:

{code}
def p = Person.get(1)
assert 1 == p.id
{code}

This uses the [get|domainClasses] method that expects a database identifier to read the @Person@ object back from the db. 
You can also load an object in a read-only state by using the [read|domainClasses] method:

{code:java}
def p = Person.read(1)
{code}

In this case the underlying Hibernate engine will not do any dirty checking and the object will not be persisted. Note that
if you explicitly call the [save|domainClasses] method then the object is placed back into a read-write state.

h4. Update

To update an instance, set some properties and then simply call [save|domainClasses] again:

{code}
def p = Person.get(1)
p.name = "Bob"
p.save()
{code}

h4. Delete

To delete an instance use the [delete|domainClasses] method:

{code}
def p = Person.get(1)
p.delete()
{code}
