Since Grails 1.2, a tag library call returns an instance of @org.codehaus.groovy.grails.web.util.StreamCharBuffer@ class by default.
This change improves performance by reducing object creation and optimizing buffering during request processing. 
In earlier Grails versions, a @java.lang.String@ instance was returned.   

Tag libraries can also return direct object values to the caller since Grails 1.2.. 
Object returning tag names are listed in a static @returnObjectForTags@ property in the tag library class.

Example:
{code:java}
class ObjectReturningTagLib {
	static namespace = "cms"
	static returnObjectForTags = ['content'] 

	def content = { attrs, body ->
		CmsContent.findByCode(attrs.code)?.content	
    }
}
{code}
