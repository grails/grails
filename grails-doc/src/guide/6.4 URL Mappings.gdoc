Throughout the documentation so far the convention used for URLs has been the default of @/controller/action/id@. However, this convention is not hard wired into Grails and is in fact controlled by a URL Mappings class located at @grails-app/conf/UrlMappings.groovy@.

The @UrlMappings@ class contains a single property called @mappings@ that has been assigned a block of code:

{code:java}
class UrlMappings {
    static mappings = {
    }	
}
{code}
