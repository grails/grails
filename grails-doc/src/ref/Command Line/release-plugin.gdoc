h2. Description

Usage: 
@grails release-plugin@

This command is for users who have access to the Grails standard plug-in repository at "http://plugins.grails.org":http://plugins.grails.org

The command allows Grails to manage the release process for you by integrating SVN with Grails. 

If you require access to repository and wish to release your plug-in there contact a member of the Grails development team. 

The command will check whether the plug-in currently exists in the repository and if not will check-in the plug-in and create a release. The command will automatically upload the plugin to a location such as @http://plugins.grails.org/grails-[name]@. It will also automatically create the following structure:

bc.
grails-[name]
   tags
      LATEST_RELEASE
      RELEASE_XY
   trunk               

The @trunk@ directory contains the current latest sources. The @tags@ directory contains tagged versions of each release and a @LATEST_RELEASE@ tag that indicates the current latest release.

If the plug-in already exists in the repository Grails will update first, then commit the latest change and finally tag the release.

Either way the plug-in will then automatically be available via the "list-plugins":list-plugins.html command.
