* @StatusFinal@ - When the test cycle completes

Executes the Grails unit and integration tests located in the @test/unit@ and @test/integration@ directories. By default all tests are executed, but you can specify the names of the tests (without the "Tests" suffix) as argument to the command:

{code:java}
grails test-app Foo
grails test-app Foo Bar
{code}

The first example will execute a test called @FooTests.groovy@ whilst the second will execute @FooTests.groovy@ and @BarTests.groovy@ if they exist.
