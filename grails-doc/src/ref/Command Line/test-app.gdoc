h2. Purpose

Runs all Grails unit and integration tests and outputs reports. The command will return appropriate response codes for embedding with continuous integration servers.

{code:java}
grails test-app
grails test-app Foo
grails test-app Foo Bar
{code}

h2. Description

Usage: 
{code:java}
grails [environment]* test-app [names]*
{code}

Fired Events:

* @StatusFinal@ - When the test cycle completes

Executes the Grails unit and integration tests located in the @test/unit@ and @test/integration@ directories. By default all tests are executed, but you can specify the names of the tests (without the "Tests" or other test type suffix) as argument to the command:

{code:java}
grails test-app Foo
grails test-app Foo Bar
{code}

The first example will execute a test called @FooTests.groovy@ whilst the second will execute @FooTests.groovy@ and @BarTests.groovy@ if they exist.

You can also choose to only run the unit or integration tests:

{code:java}
grails test-app unit:
grails test-app integration:
{code}

If you only wish to re-run failed tests use the -rerun flag

{code:java}
grails test-app -rerun
{code}

See the [Testing|guide:testing] section for examples on how to combine the different options to target tests.
